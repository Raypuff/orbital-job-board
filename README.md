CCSGP Volunteer Job Board

## Background

We are Raypuff (Rayner) and ZechAJW (Zech) and we are Year 1 Computer Science Students from NUS. This project was developed for CP2106 (Orbital) 2021.

## Aim

Our aim is to develop a web application to link organizations looking to recruit volunteers to NUS students. End users will be able to easily look for suitable volunteer opportunities on the website, and apply directly to the job-poster through our platform. Administrators from CCSGP would also be able to moderate job postings and decide what jobs are available to students.

## Link to Website

Currently we are hosting our website on vercel at the following link:

## Motivation

As Year 1 NUS students ourselves, we are not unfamiliar with the problems that students typically face when looking for volunteering opportunities to join. When Prof Ben Leong proposed this Orbital project idea, we leapt at the opportunity to sign up recognizing that there remains a sizable gap in communication with organizations looking to recruit NUS Computing students for volunteer opportunities.

Personally, our volunteering experience with SOC has been rather short-lived, as the opportunity I signed up for, a volunteer opportunity looking to introduce seniors from CareCorner Senior Activity Centre to IT, was cancelled due to insufficient volunteers and lack of proper publicity within NUS Computing. Furthermore, finding volunteer experiences relevant to my technical skill-set remains difficult, as there is no consolidated avenue to look for volunteer requests suitable for me. By the time I became aware of Code in the Community, an initiative to introduce underprivileged children to coding, the sign up period had lapsed and I missed yet another volunteering opportunity. As a result, we recognize the impact that a dedicated job board would have for the volunteering scene in NUS Computing.
