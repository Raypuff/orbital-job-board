# CCSGP Volunteer Job Board

## Who are we?

We are Loh Jia Ming, Rayner and Zechary Au Jun Wen and we are upcoming Year 2 Computer Science (as of AY21/22) Students from the National University of Singapore (NUS). This project was developed for CP2106 (Orbital) 2021 by Team NUSGrabYourOwnFood at the Artemis level under the guidance of our advisor Suther David Samuel and our mentor Mr Ng Chee Chiu from Websparks.

## Purpose and Background

The Centre for Computing for Social Good & Philanthropy (CCSGP) is a new centre set up in NUS School of Computing (SoC) since March 2021. The goal of CCSGP is to complement the technical training provided by the School of Computing by cultivating future technology leaders who have the ethos of service and giving back to society.

The **CCSGP Volunteer Job Board** has the primary purpose of connecting _interested volunteers_ from SoC with _charities/non-governmental organizations_ (NGOs) to work on community involvement projects (CIPs) to contribute to society. Through this web application, we hope that these organizations would be able to more easily recruit volunteers. Interested students will also be able to search for volunteer opportunities on a consolidated platform that provides comprehensive information so that applying for these roles become a breeze.
